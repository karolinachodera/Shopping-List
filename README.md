# Shopping List

This is a vanilla JavaScript project with Shopping List.
My goal in creating this project was to practice programming in vanilla JavaScript, especially using array methods, manipulating DOM, storing and retrieving data from local storage, and handling objects. I also created this project to practice developing a product from idea to working app entirely by myself, without ready-made solutions from the courses.
In the next step, I would like to add TypeScript to this project.

## Features

- adding products to the list with choosing a product category
- sorting products as checked and unchecked
- newly added products go as last in the unchecked part
- removing products from the list
- one-click quick adding with several products
- saving in local storage

## Features to add

- sorting by category name within unchecked products
- English version
- choosing a recipe and adding necessary products to list

## Further improvements

- add TypeScript
- improve names of variables and functions to be more descriptive
- extract reusable functions
- change functions to pure when it's possible
- add comments to specify particular parts of code
